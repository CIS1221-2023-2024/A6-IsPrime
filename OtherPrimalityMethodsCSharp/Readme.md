To see code: OtherPrimalityMethodsCSharp -> OtherPrimalityMethodsCSharp -> Progeram.cs

If you are using Visual Studio not Vistual Studio Code, Download whole file and then run the IsPrimeIterative.sln

If you are using Visual Studio Code Run Program.cs from step 1


(Note) If you are using Visual Studio Code, unless you have prior knowledge, you will not be able to run the code normally. 
 I reccomend running on just Visual Studio as all it takes is to open the .sln and click the green arrow.

If you still want to use Vs code this video may help.
