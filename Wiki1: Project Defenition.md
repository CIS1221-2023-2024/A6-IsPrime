## What are prime numbers

A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and itself. Examples include 2, 3, 5, and 7. These numbers are fundamental in number theory, forming the basis for 
expressing other integers through prime factorization. Notably, there are infinitely many prime numbers.

## Project Aim
This project delves into the vast nature of prime numbers, showcasing diverse methods to discover and apply them. From classical techniques like the Sieve of Eratosthenes to modern algorithms, it explores efficient
ways of finding primes. 

This project involves two languages: CSharp, managed by Jake, and Python, overseen by Jurgen. Each language will be implemented using two paradigmsâ€”iterative and recursive. The primary focus is on exploring various 
examples to efficiently discover prime numbers. The objective is to compare the performance of these two languages in handling prime number calculations by assessing their speed. The project aims to provide insights 
into the efficiency of different language-paradigm combinations when dealing with prime number computations.

## Project Algorithms
### Algorithm 1: Prime Checking
This is the foundation of the project. As the name suggests, it verifies whether a given number is prime or not. While the raw code might differ based on language or paradigm, the underlying 
concept remains consistent.
### Algorithm 2: All Primes Leading to a number
This Algorithm will be given a number and displays all the prime factors before that given number. This algorithm and the next will rely on algorithm 1 as they all check for primes.
### Algroithm 3: Find the nth Prime
This is a very interesting algorithm. It works similiar to algorithm 2 but with a twist. The number given will be the nth Prime, meaning if 10 was given, the 10th prime would be 29.
### Algroithm 4: Prime Factors of a Number
This algorithm will given a number, and displays any factors of that number than are prime, meaning if 12 was given, 2 and 3 will be displayed.
