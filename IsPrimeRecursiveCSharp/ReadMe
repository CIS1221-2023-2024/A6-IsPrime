To Access Code  IsPrimeRecursiveCSharp -> IsPrimeRecursiveCSharp -> Program.cs

If you are using Visual Studio not Vistual Studio Code, Download whole file and then run the IsPrimeRecursiveCSharp.sln

If you are using Visual Studio Code Run Program.cs from step 1

(Note) If you are using Visual Studio Code, unless you have prior knowledge, you will not be able to run the code normally. 
Unless you want to install extentions and modules and connect the location of the file, I reccomend running on just Visual Studio 
All it takes is to open the .sln and click the green arrow, simple as that.
