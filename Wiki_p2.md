# Edge Cases & Breaking points
Testing Edge Cases is when extreme or unusal inputs are entered to see how the program executes, some examples would be to enter a negative number, a floating point number, or a very large number. The purpose of testing edge cases, is to check wether the program is able to handle such extreme inputs.
  
The breaking point of the program is when the input entered is so large that the program cannot handle executing as it would be beyond its capabilities, testing the breaking point is important, as it gives us a clear limit to how far the program can go
