# A6-IsPrime

This Project is worked on by Jake Carabott and Jurgen Cauchi.
The aim of this project is to test different algorithms, languages and paradigms when it comes to identifying wether a number is prime or not.
Each Language will have 2 paradigms which will be Iterative and Recursive.
Jake will handle the C# language and Jurgen will handle the Python language.
Things to note can be key differences when working with 2 different languages and 2 different paradigms and identifying which is faster or efficiant to produce.
We hope you find our code satisfactory.


Note: Jurgen's Projects are handled using VS Code, while Jake's Projects are using VS. Therefore make sure to read the ReadMe in the CSharp Folders to undertstand how to see and run the code :)
