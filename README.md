# IsPrime Project

## About the project

The aim of this project is to test different algorithms, and paradigms when it comes to identifying wether a number is a prime number (only divisible by 1 and itself) or not, and other functions relating to prime numbers such as finding all the prime factors of a number, or finding every prime number between 2 limits using python and C#.  
  
Things to note can be key differences when working with 2 different languages and 2 different paradigms and identifying which is faster or more efficient to produce.
Both languages will make use of Iteration, Recursion, and the following primality algorithms: Sieve of Eratosthenes, Miller-Rabin Primality and the Fermat Method
We hope you find our code satisfactory.

## Team Members

- Jurgen Cauchi - Python
- Jake Carabott - C#

## How to run the programs 
Jurgen's Projects (Python) are written using VS Code, so all that is needed is to open the .py files using VS Code  
Jake's Projects (C#) are written using VS. So make sure to read the ReadMe in the CSharp Folders to understand how to see and run the code :)
