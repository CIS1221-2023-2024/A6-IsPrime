Some notes: 
While testing out the C# programs, I decided that comparing the C# algorithms was rather futile. This is since the improvements will be minimally apperant and the algorithms provided by the team were already optimized and efficient for that specific paradigm (be it iterative or recursive).
 
Additionally, I would like to provide the same Primality Algorithms in C# that the team can compare their own paradigms to. For example, the implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which the team can then compare to the 'find prime numbers up to function' either in a recursive or iterative paradigm. I believe that these mathematical algorithms will further increase the realiability and complexity of the project itself.
