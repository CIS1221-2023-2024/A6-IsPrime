# Comparing The Results
In this section, we will be comparing the Speed and the memory used between different algorithms of the same language, and between the 2 languages (C# and Python)  
The different algorithms being:
- iteration
- Recursion 
- Other Primality Methods
  
These will be tested using inputs spanning from 0 up to hundreds of thousands to check which algorithms are more superior when executing smaller numbers or larger numbers.

## Comparison within Python
The algorithms written in Python will be compared to find which algorithms are superior

### Executing Speeds

### Memory Used

### Conclusion 



## Comparison within C#





## Comparison of Python vs C#  
The results from both the Python and C# languages will be compared to find which language is superior when it comes to finding prime numbers
