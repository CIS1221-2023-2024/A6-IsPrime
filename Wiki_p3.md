# Comparing The Results
In this section, we will be comparing the Speed and the memory used between different algorithms of the same language, and between the 2 languages (C# and Python)  
The different algorithms are:
- iteration
- Recursion 
- Other Primality Methods
  
These will be tested using inputs spanning from 0 up to hundreds of thousands to check which algorithms are superior when executing smaller numbers or larger numbers.
To ensure fairness, the same numbers were inputted. The following numbers were used:
  
- 0 - To check how quickly the algorithms could return nothing  
- 2 - Checking how fast the first prime number could be found  
- 35 - A small non-prime number that is not divisible by 2  
- 53 - A small prime number  
- 1,153 - A larger prime number  
- 1,357 - A larger non-prime number  
- 10,069 - A 5-digit prime number  
- 10,197 - A 5-digit non-prime number  
- 100,129 - A 6-digit prime number  
- 102,676 - A 6-digit non-prime number   
- 601,831 - A larger 6-digit prime number  
- 700,239 - A larger 6-digit non-prime number  


## Comparison within Python
The algorithms written in Python will be compared to find which algorithms are superior

### Execution Speeds
To test the execution speeds of the algorithms, the timeit module was used to find the time taken to execute. Since the execution speeds are not always the same, a rough average was taken  
Every number was tested in the algorithms, and the speeds were noted down in this Excel datasheet:

the / denotes that the algorithm could not handle that input and the Âµs denotes a microsecond which equates to 0.000001 of a second

### Is Prime Methods
  
From observing the results, when working with the main algorithms to check for primality, while trying to find a non-prime number or working with small numbers, with Iteration and Recursion there is only a small difference in speeds with Iteration being almost always faster. However, when the input is a prime number, the iteration algorithm proved to be much faster than recursion.

The Miller-Rabin algorithm was significantly slower than iteration when working with small numbers, however when the numbers got very large, the Miller-Rabin proved be significantly faster.

The Fermat Method was faster than the Miller-Rabin using small numbers, however even when the number enters the thousand mark, it starts to execute much slower

### Finding all prime factors
In this algorithm, Recursion only ever was faster when checking for 0 or 2, it was much slower than iteration and stopped computing after the number 1357

When working with small numbers, the Sieve Of Eratosthenes is slower than the iterative algorithm, however as the number got larger and larger, it also became much faster

### Nth prime
Similarly as shown from the previous algorithms, the iterative algorithm proved to be superior with speeds twice as fast in this case, and was able to compute with much larger numbers, unlike the recursive algoritm  where it stopped working after the number 53

### Memory Used
The memory profiler module was used to calculate the memory used by the isprime algorithms. A profile was created to check the memory used  
All the algorithms (Iterative, Recursive, Millar-Rabin and Fermat Method) all use roughly 23Mb

### Conclusion 
For the task of finding prime numbers, Iterative programming not only outperforms Recursive programming in terms of speed but also demonstrates superior performance with significantly larger numbers.  
The Millar-Rabin algorithm has proven to be exceptionally fast and efficient, particularly in checking the primality of numbers even after exceeding 30 digits.  
Similarly, the Sieve Of Eratosthenes has demonstrated speed and efficiency, especially when generating a list of prime numbers for large input values.  
Notably, memory usage is consistent across these methods, making it a less decisive factor in their comparison.

## Comparison within C#
### Execution Speeds
A Stopwatch Function has been Implimented to test each end every algorithm with multiple inputs representing Primes and not Primes. Inputs are similiar to Python to keep an accurate Comparison

From this sheet, we can denote that the **fastest** algorithms belong to the **Miller-Robin** and the **Fermat** methods, achieving remarkable speeds as low as 0.0000001 seconds. In contrast, the **slowest** algorithm, Nth Prime, takes 11 seconds to complete. It's important to acknowledge that some records are omitted due to the recursive limit inherent in the language, preventing the function from iterating infinitely and impacting the inclusion of specific algorithmic records in the analysis. To add on, the data clearly demonstrates that recursive algorithms exhibit faster execution speeds than their iterative counterparts. However, it's unfortunate that recursive algorithms face limitations when handling larger numbers. In summary, recursion is advantageous for speed, while iteration is better suited for handling larger inputs.

### Memory Used
Using the Process.GetCurrentProcess Function, the memory used is calculated which ranges about **12** to **13** Mib throught out all paradigms and all algorithms which is almost half as much as python uses.
